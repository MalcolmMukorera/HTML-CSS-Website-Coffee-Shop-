# HTML-CSS-Website-Coffee-Shop-
This is my first HTML/CSS website project made from scratch. It took me about 2 days to get it to this point. I learnt a lot through making this project and gave me a good basis to any other website i will create from now on

# Malcolm&co - A Coffee Shop Website

This is a description of my first solo HTML and CSS project - a web page promoting a coffee shop named "Malcolm&Co".

## Banner

The webpage opens with a warm, welcoming banner that spans the full width of the screen. The banner features a high-resolution image of a steaming cup of coffee, with the shop's slogan - "Star you day with our coffee" - overlaid in bold, white letters. The colour scheme of the page is a mix of blacks and greys, reminiscent of a nice gloomy day with the coffee being the centre piece .

## Navigation Bar

Just above the banner, there's a navigation bar with links to different sections of the website: "Home", "Menu", "About", and "Contact". The navigation bar is styled with a clean, modern design, and it stays fixed at the top of the page as you scroll down. It still needs code to function but this is a visual representation of the website


## Our Story

The "Our Story" section is a single column of text centered on a textured, coffee-colored background. It tells the story of how the coffee shop was started, adding a personal touch to the website.


## Contact

Finally, the "Contact" section includes a simple form for visitors to send messages to the coffee shop. The form fields are styled with rounded corners and subtle box shadows, giving them a 3D effect.

## Responsiveness

The webpage is responsive, with media queries in the CSS ensuring it looks good on devices of all sizes. It's a testament to your skills in HTML and CSS, and a great first solo project!
